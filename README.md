# PYTHON-PROJECTS
This folder stores some of the projects I have worked on using Python programming language. Some of the Python projects used commonly known open-source datasets, from past courses, from Kaggle competitions, etc. This is basically to store the knowledge (programming structures, methods, machine learning algorithms) that I have learned over time.
